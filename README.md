# Anycolorwillwork

(play it here)[https://anycolorwill.work/]
A small game that tests your colour perception. Is it white with a blue shadow, or blue under bright yellow light?
Inspired by the dress that caused the entire world to collectively go insane.
This game uses this formula to compute the colour distance: (CompuPhase's colour metric formula)[https://www.compuphase.com/cmetric.htm] which emulates the non-linear way humans perceive colour.
